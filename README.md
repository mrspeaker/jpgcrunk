# jpgcrunk by Mr Speaker

jpgcrunk is a tool for crunking images. 

## How to use

Drag an image into the "drag n drop" area. Mess around with the sliders. The sliders set some properties of the random number generator. Pressing the "next" button will generate crunks with those properties. If you see a crunk you like, but was spamming the "next" button, you can hit "prev" to go back.

You can also crunk slide-show style with the RUN button.

The "rnd" button will give a random seed value and random slider settings. If you have the same slider values, and seed, you'll always get the same images.

If you see something you like, either right-click and save it, or hit "make png" to add it to your preview list.

## Parameters

## Only jpgs?! 

Nope... well, it's complicated. The source file doesn't have to be a jpeg, but it's encoded as a jpeg with lots of jpeg crunkiness. If you right-click and save the image, you'll get a jpeg. If you hit the "make png" button, it will be save into the preview section as a png.

# TODO

* Save settings as previews
* Allow prev with settings (not just seed)
* Unique filenames (from init image name)
* Scrollable preview pane
* Warnings on big images
* Add meta data to generated images
* Take photo
* Allow dragging saved crunked image into uploader
